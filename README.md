# JavaScript-Projects
There is some minor JavaSript projects, which I have done during the learning of javascript.

## 1 - Personel Note
In this project you can save your reminder for upcomming events.

## 2 - Library
In the library project you can add new book into the library and remove then from the library whenever you want.
